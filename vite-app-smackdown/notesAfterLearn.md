TODAY I LEARNING SOMETHING INCREADIBLE. THESE ALL I HAD LEARNED : 

1. HOW The HOOK STATE REACTJS works (useState,useEffect).

2. HOW The GETTER AND SETTER work in reactjs for HOOK statement

3. HOW To create a root folder such as for the client itself, or for the server itself for better look

4. HOW EXPRESS work but that's much mistakes that i make it, it's req is not a function, that's common mistakes! HAHAHAAHA

5. THAT's much mistakes i make, the one is wrong installing outside the src file which is package.json in src, 
    that not problem~ i'll try my best and gonna fix it!!!

6. HOW GITIGNORE ignoring an HAZARD file that is not allowed for commiting upstream in github repo

7. I learn THE ARRAY [] in reactjs hook state, thats for second argument, because i was declaring the 
   useState first and then create again the hook named useEffect.


THAT's it! THE ABOVE is MY NOTE DURING LEARNING PROGRAMMING, HOPE I'm GOING to be a front-end dev or fullStack!
